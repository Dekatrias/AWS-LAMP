# LAMP Stack CloudFormation Template

This repository contains a CloudFormation template that deploys a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack in AWS. The template sets up the entire stack in a highly available and scalable fashion.

## Template Details

The template deploys the following resources:

- VPC, with subnets, route tables, and an internet gateway
- Security Groups for EC2 and RDS instances
- EC2 Instances for the Apache Web Server
- RDS MySQL instance for the database
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic to EC2 instances
- Auto Scaling Group to manage the EC2 instances

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the template, you should have the following:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Sufficient permissions to create the resources mentioned above

## Deployment

To deploy the LAMP stack using this CloudFormation template, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the Template**: Upload the `lamp-stack-template.yaml` file to an S3 bucket in your AWS account.

2. **Launch the Stack**:
   - Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.
   - Click on 'Create stack' and select 'With new resources (standard)'.
   - Choose 'Upload a template file', click 'Choose file', and select the `lamp-stack-template.yaml` file.
   - Click 'Next' and provide the stack name and parameters as required.
   - Review the configuration and click 'Create stack'.

3. **Monitor the Stack Creation**: 
   - CloudFormation will show the progress of the stack creation.
   - Wait until the stack status changes to `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - After the stack creation is complete, you can find the URL of the load balancer in the Outputs section of the stack.
   - Visit the URL to verify that the LAMP stack is deployed and operational.

## Architecture Diagram

(optional section, if you want to include a diagram of how the LAMP stack is set up)

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that your RDS instances are not publicly accessible and can only be accessed by the EC2 instances.
- Update the security groups to restrict access to the necessary ports only (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- Regularly update your EC2 instances to patch any security vulnerabilities.

## Cleanup

To delete the stack and all the associated resources:

- Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.
- Select the stack you want to delete.
- Click on 'Delete' and confirm the deletion.

Please note that deleting the stack will remove all the resources, including the data in the RDS instance.
